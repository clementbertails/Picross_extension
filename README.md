# Picross_extension
This project is my first chrome_extension. This one is to help with picross resolution

This extension calculates the value of a line and considers breaks.
The program doesn't solve the Picross puzzle itself, but it allows you to see the information about the number of filled squares at a glance.

TODO : preview of possible lines
